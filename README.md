# Formula 1

This is an arcade game inspired by [Arlington Horse Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Horse_Racing) made with GLFW and SOIL libraries.

The race is completely random based on a [generation of distances](https://github.com/DragosBalmau/TemePOO/blob/main/Game.cpp#L88), which the cars cover at every step until one reaches the finish line.
